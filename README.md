# Hi, I am Timmi.
## Welcome to my crunchy, fresh and new github page - as well as account.

I am currently looking for new experiences where i am able to live out my diverse interests. 
i will launch some open repositories as soon as i understand where i want 0to start ;).

my interests are spread between Arts and Zeta functions and a lot of classical computer science topics like compiler construction, artificial intelligence, information theory etc. I love designing and creatingg experiences from front to backend for all creatures.

See you around!
